# python-little-project
 half done project for 'cyber security'

1.open the entire folder in python IDE.
2.import eel and all other modules in the app.py file.
3.move the client.py to another PC on the same network.
4.change the ip and port in client.py to the one of the app.py PC.
5.run app.py and when waiting for connection on the "simple TCP connection" activate the client as well.

maybe i'll update this with time, but feel free with the code.
